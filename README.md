# Assignment Submission Portal

## Overview

This is a backend system for an **Assignment Submission Portal** where **Users** can upload assignments, and **Admins** can review, accept, or reject assignments. The system is built using **Flask** and **MongoDB** for storage.

### Key Features:
- Users can register, log in, and upload assignments.
- Admins can register, log in, view, accept, or reject assignments.

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.x** installed on your machine.
2. **MongoDB** installed or use a cloud MongoDB service (e.g., [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)).
3. **Postman** to test the API (or you can use cURL).

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

Database Information
The project uses MongoDB to store users, assignments, and their statuses.
You do not need to include the database in the repository; the system will automatically interact with MongoDB once you set up the connection string in app.py (change the MongoDB URI to your database's URI).
Conclusion
Once youâ€™ve followed these steps, you should be able to test all the functionalities of the Assignment Submission Portal using Postman. If you encounter any issues, feel free to reach out or open an issue on the GitHub repository.
